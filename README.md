# IoT-composting-bin
A simple composting bin project that uses Arduino Uno, ultrasonic distance sensor, micro servo and soil moisture sensor. This project is still ongoing; needs to add additional features such as sending notification when the composting mixture is too dry or too wet and a monitoring dashboard.
